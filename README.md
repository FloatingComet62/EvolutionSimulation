# Evolution Simulation
I wanted to build an evolution simulation for an experiment I will talk about later

# How gene system works
Note: This system in no way is trying to claim how actually genes work. It's only purpose is the simulate
mistakes that occur. E.g. a gene offset which causes a malformed individual.

Gene of an entity is just an array of numbers and at random intervals, there is a small deviation in the value, either positive or negative.

LOWER deviation of a gene from the mean represents defects, and a higher chance of dying.
Why Lower? Imagine inbreeding.
Also a small random chance of dying in general.

## Reproduction
Sexual, 50% gene from one + 50% gene from other.

How they meet? Fuck it, randomly choose 2 entities and mate them. No requirement for them to be close, because that's not the fucking point.

The point is the study the how the defects compound in a modern society.
